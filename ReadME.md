# FastAPI SAAS Template
FastAPI is a web framework which can be applied to various problems. Building Subscription As a Service application is one use case.

As such I left the need to create a template that provides a lot of base/out of the box features such as 
Configs, Migrations, Authentication, Authorization and Permissions.

The core of the Application is a User Auth module and Organizations.

Organization is a team with team members. Invites can be sent via Links which can be revoked.

Permissions include freemium block checks as dependencies, an example is limiting the number of organizations a freemium user can have to 2.


Admin right actions: Only Admin can perform such actions.
Strict Member Actions.
